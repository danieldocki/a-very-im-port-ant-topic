- Client-side database
- Hand-written native code to wrap DB

## The Sadness
- Runtime errors ðŸ˜­
- No compiler help

## The Conversation
- Mentioned in Slack bad experience with native code
- Mentioned that using ports would be even worse

## The Change of Perspective
- Evan replied
- I had been using an incorrect mental model of ports
- I revised my brain and re-architected

# The Result
- No more native code
- ðŸ’¸ðŸ’°ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’¸ðŸ’°ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’¸ðŸ’°ðŸ¤‘
- Elm & JS remain separate worlds with separate concerns
- Scaling JS-Elm interaction is simple (a simple pattern is simple to follow)

-- guide.elm-lang.org

# Attempt 1

# JavaScript as a service

- Ports make JavaScript == Service
  - BUT
    - Service `/=` server
    - Ports `/=` HTTP + Promises
